<h2> Interview with an English Major about Shakespeare <small>I guess</small> </h2>

<strong> Elliot: </strong> So what can I interview you about?
<br>
<strong> Sydney: </strong> Like nothing, can you count how many times I say um?
 <br>
<strong> E: </strong>  Haha sure.
<br>
<strong> S: </strong> Really think about it. I don’t know anything about anything.
<br>
<strong> E: </strong>  Hold on I have to record this so I can type it all up later.
<br>
<strong> S: </strong> This is so stressful for me.
<br>
<strong> E: </strong>  Ok so, Shakespeare, what do you know about him English major?
<br>
<strong> S: </strong> I don’t know.
<br>
<strong> E: </strong>  So like what’s a <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/learn/glossary-terms/sonnet">sonnet</a>? Shakespeare wrote them.
<br>
<strong> S: </strong> It has fourteen lines, usually about love, and usually by a guy about a woman who he can’t have.
Usually in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iambic_pentameter">iambic pentameter</a>
<small>(she stuttered).</small> There’s two different kinds but I can’t remember. American people were like <i>“we
 want our own sonnet,”</i> and so an American sonnet is any poem with fourteen lines that calls itself a sonnet, cus that’s just
 how it is. I’m bad at them because iambic pentameter stresses me out.
<br>
<strong> E: </strong>  Yeah you know a lot about poetry.
<br>
<strong> S: </strong> I’ve taken two poetry classes…
<br>
<strong> E: </strong>  Do you have a favorite Shakespeare play?
<br>
<strong> S: </strong> My favorite play is <a href="http://shakespeare.mit.edu/cleopatra/full.html" ><i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> </a>
or <a href="http://shakespeare.mit.edu/macbeth/full.html"><i>Macbeth</i> </a>.
<br>
<strong> E: </strong>  How come?
<br>
<strong> S: </strong> Um, I like <i>Antony and Cleopatra </i> because it’s the most poetic one and it’s pretty emo.
 And I like <i>Macbeth </i> because there’s witches, and I have this haircut so I have to like witches.
<br>
<strong> E+S: </strong> <i>Haha </i>
<br>
<strong> E: </strong>  Anything else you wanna say?
<br>
<strong> S: </strong> No.
