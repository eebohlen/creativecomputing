    <i> Elliot:</i>  So what can I interview you about?
    <br>
    <strong> Sydney: Like nothing, can you count how many times I say um?  </strong>
     <br>
    <i> E: Haha sure.</i>
    <br>
    <strong> S: Really think about it. I don’t know anything about anything.</strong>
    <br>
    <i> E: </i>  Hold on I have to record this so I can type it all up later.
    <br>
    <strong> S: This is so stressful for me. </strong>
    <br>
    <i> E: </i>  Ok so, Shakespeare, what do you know about him English major?
    <br>
    <strong> S: I don’t know.</strong>
    <br>
    <i> E: </i>  So like what’s a <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/learn/glossary-terms/sonnet">sonnet</a>? Shakespeare wrote them.
    <br>
    <strong> S:  It has fourteen lines, usually about love, and usually by a guy about a woman who he can’t have.
    Usually in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iambic_pentameter">iambic pentameter</a>
    <small>(she stuttered).</small> There’s two different kinds but I can’t remember. American people were like <i>“we
     want our own sonnet,”</i> and so an American sonnet is any poem with fourteen lines that calls itself a sonnet, cus that’s just
     how it is. I’m bad at them because iambic pentameter stresses me out.</strong>
    <br>
    <i> E: </i>  Yeah you know a lot about poetry.
    <br>
    <strong> S: I’ve taken two poetry classes…</strong>
    <br>
    <i> E: </i>  Do you have a favorite Shakespeare play?
    <br>
    <strong> S:  My favorite play is <a href="http://shakespeare.mit.edu/cleopatra/full.html" ><i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> </a>
    or <a href="http://shakespeare.mit.edu/macbeth/full.html"><i>Macbeth</i> </a>.</strong>
    <br>
    <i> E: </i>  How come?
    <br>
    <strong> S:  Um, I like <i>Antony and Cleopatra </i> because it’s the most poetic one and it’s pretty emo.
     And I like <i>Macbeth </i> because there’s witches, and I have this haircut so I have to like witches.</strong>
    <br>
    <strong> E+S: </strong> <i>Haha </i>
    <br>
    <i> E: </i>  Anything else you wanna say?
    <br>
    <strong> S: No.</strong>
    <br> <BR>
